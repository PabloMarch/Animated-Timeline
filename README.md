## Introduction

**Timeline** is an animation library for React which makes it painless to create timeline and playback based animations. It is inspired from the existing physics based models and is here just because of the hard work that has already been done by the great developers. It focuses on improving the developer experience and has an API which is relatively similar to React Native. It also shares the same philosophy with React Native which is -

> **_focus on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and simple start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution._**

Along with `start` and `stop` methods it also provides -

* `restart` - To replay the animation

* `reset` - To reset animation timeline

* `reverse` - To reverse the animation

* `seek` - An interactive way to control the animation throughout it's progress.

It also provides lifecycle hooks that gets executed during different phases of an animation. Read more [here]()

Besides the library usage, **Timeline** aims to amplify the usage of interaction design in our development process and also encourages to create interactive tools on top of the API that it already provides to create animations.

## Install

```
npm install animated-timeline
```

or if you use yarn

```
yarn add animated-timeline
```

**This library also depends on `react` and `react-dom` so make sure you've already installed it.**

## Usage

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { Timeline, helpers } from "animated-timeline";

const { start } = helpers;

const timeline = new Timeline({
  direction: "alternate",
  easing: "easeInOutSine",
  loop: true,
  duration: 2000
});

const { Animated } = timeline.init();

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.value({
      elements: this.one,
      translateX: start({ from: 500, to: 10 }),
      opacity: start({ from: 0.4, to: 0.9 }),
      rotate: {
        value: 360,
        easing: "easeInOutSine"
      }
    }).start();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div
        ref={one => (this.one = one)}
        style={{
          width: "20px",
          height: "20px",
          backgroundColor: "pink"
        }}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

**Result**

</p>

In the above example, we created a `timeline` instance by passing an object of animation attributes to the `Timeline` class. The animation attributes are used to configure an animation timeline so you can decide what should be `direction`, `easing`, `duration` value etc, throughout the animation timeline.

> Note - Defining animation attributes is optional and can be skipped.

After that, we initialise the timeline by calling the instance method `init` on our timeline instance. This returns the main `Animated` object and also an `AnimationTimeline` component (we will look into this later).

The `Animated` object is used to hook up one or more style attributes of an element or elements which you want to animate. This is done by calling `.value()` on `Animated` and passing an object of animatable properties.

You will need to specify a selector (`className`, `id` or a reference to the element) to animate an element otherwise `Animated` won't be able to infer which elements are supposed to be animated.

**classname**

```js
// Element to be animated
<div className="sample" />;

// Specify the element and animation properties
Animated.value({
  // Element with class 'sample'
  elements: ".sample",
  translateX: 400,
  rotate: {
    value: 360,
    direction: "alternate"
  }
});
```

**id**

```js
// Element to be animated
<div id="sample" />;

// Specify the element and animation properties
Animated.value({
  // Element with class 'sample'
  elements: "#sample",
  translateX: 400,
  rotate: {
    value: 360,
    direction: "alternate"
  }
});
```

**refs**

```js
// Element to be animated
<div ref={sample => (this.sample = sample)} />;

Animated.value({
  elements: this.sample,
  translateX: 400,
  rotate: {
    value: 360,
    direction: "alternate"
  }
});
```

You can also pass an array of elements to the property `elements` to animate a group of elements with similar properties like -

```js
Animated.value({
  // Element with class 'sample'
  elements: [this.sample, '.one', '#two', .three],
  translateX: 400,
  rotate: {
    value: 360,
    direction: 'alternate'
  }
})
```

`Animated.Value` can bind to style properties, and can also be chained for performing sequence based animations (we will look into this later). A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties (similar to [React Native]())

Now to start the animation, call `.start()` on Animated.

```js
Animated.value({ ...props }).start();

// or

Animated.value({
  ...props
});

// Starts the animation
Animated.start();
```

### Working with animations

#### Playback based animations

You can also use playback controls to control the execution of an animation via `start` and `stop` methods. Let's take an example -

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { Timeline, helpers } from "animated-timeline";

const { start } = helpers;

const timeline = new Timeline({
  direction: "alternate",
  easing: "easeInOutSine",
  loop: true,
  duration: 2000
});

const { Animated } = timeline.init();

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.value({
      elements: this.one,
      translateX: start({ from: 500, to: 10 }),
      opacity: start({ from: 0.4, to: 0.9 }),
      rotate: {
        value: 360,
        easing: "easeInOutSine"
      }
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <div
          ref={one => (this.one = one)}
          style={{
            width: "20px",
            height: "20px",
            backgroundColor: "pink"
          }}
        />
        <button onClick={e => Animated.start()}>Play</button>
        <button onClick={e => Animated.stop()}>Pause</button>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Sequence based animations

You can also do sequence based animations by chaining up multiple values using `.value` on `Animated` object. Let's take an example -

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { Timeline, helpers } from "animated-timeline";

const { start } = helpers;

const timeline = new Timeline({
  direction: "alternate",
  easing: "easeInOutSine",
  loop: true,
  duration: 2000
});

const { Animated } = timeline.init();

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.value({
      elements: this.one,
      translateX: start({ from: 500, to: 10 }),
      opacity: start({ from: 0.4, to: 0.9 }),
      rotate: {
        value: 360,
        easing: "easeInOutSine"
      }
    })
      .value({
        elements: ".two",
        translateX: start({ from: 10, to: 500 }),
        opacity: start({ from: 0.2, to: 0.5 })
      })
      .value({
        elements: "#three",
        translateX: start({ from: 300, to: 700 }),
        opacity: start({ from: 0.4, to: 0.6 }),
        rotate: {
          value: 180,
          easing: "easeInOutSine",
          direction: "alternate"
        }
      });

    Animated.start();
  }

  render() {
    const styles = {
      width: "20px",
      height: "20px",
      backgroundColor: "pink",
      marginTop: 10
    };

    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <div ref={one => (this.one = one)} style={styles} />
        <div className="two" style={styles} />
        <div id="three" style={styles} />
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```

### Dynamically changing the animation progress

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { Timeline, helpers } from "animated-timeline";

const { start } = helpers;

const timeline = new Timeline({
  direction: "alternate",
  easing: "easeInOutSine",
  loop: true,
  duration: 2000
});

const { Animated, AnimationTimeline } = timeline.init();

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    value: 0
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.value({
      elements: this.one,
      translateX: start({ from: 500, to: 10 }),
      opacity: start({ from: 0.4, to: 0.9 }),
      rotate: {
        value: 360,
        easing: "easeInOutSine"
      }
    });
  }

  handleChange = e => this.setState({ value: e.target.value });

  render() {
    return (
      <AnimationTimeline seek={ctrl => ctrl.default(this.state.value)}>
        <div
          ref={one => (this.one = one)}
          style={{
            width: "20px",
            height: "20px",
            backgroundColor: "pink"
          }}
        />
        <input
          type="range"
          min="0"
          max="100"
          value={this.state.value}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
        />
      </AnimationTimeline>
    );
  }
}
```

<p align="center">

</p>

### Lifecycle hooks

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { Timeline, helpers } from "animated-timeline";

const { start } = helpers;

const timeline = new Timeline({
  direction: "alternate",
  easing: "easeInOutSine",
  speed: 0.09
});

const { Animated, AnimationTimeline } = timeline.init();

export class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.value({
      elements: this.one,
      translateX: start({ from: 500, to: 10 }),
      opacity: start({ from: 0.4, to: 0.9 }),
      rotate: {
        value: 360,
        easing: "easeInOutSine"
      }
    }).start();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <AnimationTimeline
          lifecycle={{
            // Called when the animation starts
            // If there is any delay, then it will be invoked after that delay timeout
            onStart: ({ duration }) => {},
            // Invoked whenever there is any new update (state updates, events)
            // Avoiding calling setState here because React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.
            // You can sync the animation progress with the input value here
            onUpdate: ({ progress }) => {},
            // Frame loop (called every frame)
            callFrame: ({ remaining }) => {},
            // Invoked when the animation is done
            onComplete: ({ completed }) => {
              console.log("Completed: " + completed);
              console.log("Starting again...");

              if (completed) {
                // Reverse the direction
                Animated.reverse();
                // Restart the animation again
                Animated.restart();
              }
            }
          }}
        />
        <div
          ref={one => (this.one = one)}
          style={{
            width: "20px",
            height: "20px",
            backgroundColor: "pink"
          }}
        />
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```

The above examples addressed only single elements and were not showing sequence based animations. Let's see how we can create sequence based animations using the API.

### Using chaining to perform sequencing animations

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { Timeline, helpers } from "animated-timeline";

const { start, startBefore, startAfter } = helpers;

const timeline = new Timeline({
  direction: "alternate",
  easing: "easeInOutSine",
  loop: true,
  speed: 0.5
});

const { Animated } = timeline.init();

const boxStyles = {
  width: "20px",
  height: "20px",
  backgroundColor: "pink"
};

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    Animated.value({
      elements: this.one,
      translateX: start({ from: 500, to: 20 }),
      opacity: start({ from: 0.4, to: 0.9 }),
      rotate: {
        value: 180
      }
    })
      .value({
        elements: this.two,
        translateX: 300,
        elasticity: 900,
        rotate: {
          value: 360,
          easing: "easeInOutSine"
        },
        // Start animating this 1.2s before the previous animation ends
        offset: startBefore(1200)
      })
      .value({
        elements: this.three,
        translateX: 500,
        elasticity: 1000,
        // Start animating this 1.1s after the previous animation ends
        offset: startAfter(100)
      });

    Animated.start();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <div ref={one => (this.one = one)} style={boxStyles}>
          A
        </div>
        <div
          ref={two => (this.two = two)}
          style={{ ...boxStyles, marginTop: 20 }}
        >
          B
        </div>
        <div
          ref={three => (this.three = three)}
          style={{ ...boxStyles, marginTop: 30 }}
        >
          C
        </div>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}
```
