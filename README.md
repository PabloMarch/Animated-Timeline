## Introduction

`Timeline` is a React based library to create timeline and playback animations without any pain. It allows you to create beautiful animations with ease using React and hence minimising the cognitive friction in your development process because creating animation should always be a fun thing. It does not introduces new features in the current physics based models which are used for animations but rather it is inspired from those projects and is here just because of the hard work that has already been done by the great developers. It focuses on improving the user experience and has an API which is relatively similar to React Native. It also shares the same philosophy similar to React Native which is -

> ***focus on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and simple start/stop methods to control time-based animation execution.***

Along with `start` and `stop` methods it also provides -

* `restart` - To replay the animation

* `reset` - To reset animation timeline

* `reverse` - To reverse the animation

* `seek` - An interactive way to control the animation throughout it's progress.

It also provides lifecycle hooks that gets executed during different phases of an animation. Read more [here]()

Besides the library usage, `Timeline` aims to amplify the usage of interaction design in our development process and also encourages to create interactive tools on top of the API that it already provides to create animations.
